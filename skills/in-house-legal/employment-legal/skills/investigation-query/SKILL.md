# /investigation-query

Answers questions against the investigation log — what witnesses said,
where accounts conflict, what gaps exist, what the strongest evidence is
on each issue.

## Instructions

1. Load the `internal-investigation` reference skill and run Mode 3 (Query).
2. Always cite log entry IDs in the answer.
3. If the log contains nothing relevant to the question, say so explicitly —
   "I have not seen any information on [topic] in this investigation log
   ([N] entries reviewed)" — and offer to flag it as a gap.

## Examples

```
investigation-query [matter name]
What did the respondent say about the December team dinner?
```

```
investigation-query [matter name]
Where do the complainant's and respondent's accounts conflict?
```

```
investigation-query [matter name]
What do we still need?
```
